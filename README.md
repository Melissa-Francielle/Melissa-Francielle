#### **Something's about me!**
I am currently 24 years old (02 line hehehe), you can use the pronouns she/her with me! I have a degree in Computer Science from UENP (State University of Northern Paraná - BRAZIL).

For two years, I was part of a project calling **NINOEDU**, that developed educational games for children with intellectual disabilities, where I worked as a designer, illustrator, and developer!

I enjoy drawing, games, and music. In my free time, I love just being by myself doing my own little things, haha! I like spending time alone, but I also enjoy spending time with family and friends.

#### **Curiosities**
* I've been a designer for almost 19 years (18 years in traditional art and 6 in digital).

* I enjoy learning musical instruments; I know guitar and keyboard.

* I like games; I've developed some both as part of a project and independently. You can find one of my best works here: [Retro Pentium](https://github.com/Melissa-Francielle/Retro_Pentium)
